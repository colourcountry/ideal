# IDEAL-5

IDEAL is a fantasy hardware developer from a timeline where the 80s never ended.

The IDEAL-5 has

* hi-resolution, tintable character based graphics
* hundreds of characters in ROM, drawn from the Unicode character set as well as its own library
* vertically-oriented touch screen display
* batteries-included [programming](doc/keywords.md) based on Lua

It does not have

* sound (but you can listen to your own tunes while you play)
* user definable sprites (but you can submit them to the manufacturer for inclusion in the next ROM release)
