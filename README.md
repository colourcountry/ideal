# IDEAL 5

IDEAL is a fantasy hardware developer who launched a touch screen console, the IDEAL 5, in the fourth decade of the 80s. Unfortunately
their product was the size of a small suitcase, ruinously expensive, and the sound chip proved to run at a dangerously high
temperature and had to be hurriedly removed from every unit by the distributors. Sadly, the product failed; there are literally none
left in existence today. But thanks to modern technology, you can play all the IDEAL games that were ever released (currently 1) on
your smart phone. And you can code new ones, in Lua, naturally.

The IDEAL 5 has

* hi-resolution, tintable character based graphics
* hundreds of characters in ROM, drawn from the Unicode character set as well as its own library
* vertically-oriented touch screen display
* batteries-included [programming](doc/keywords.md) based on Lua

It does not have

* sound (but you can listen to your own tunes while you play)
* user definable sprites (but you can submit a pull request to the manufacturer to have new code points defined in the next ROM release)
