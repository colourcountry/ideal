## T 
The number of frames elapsed since the current MODE started up.

The IDEAL machine runs at 30 frames per second, but if you want to measure real times, use TIMER instead.
 

## TAU 
2Ï€, the period of the sine and cosine functions. 

## TIMER 
Manage the internal timer.

The timer starts at 999 and counts down in seconds.
```
@ TIMER()
994.4867219
```

Supply a number as a parameter to set the timer to this many seconds.
```
@ TIMER(60)
60
```

If 999 seconds elapse within the same MODE, the IDEAL machine will forcibly restart that MODE.
You can use the default timer to help you prevent this happening.
Resetting the timer does not affect this feature.
